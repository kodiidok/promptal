I'll create a comprehensive 5-week lesson plan for a beginner practical course in parallel computing with CUDA and OpenMP. This course will provide hands-on experience with both technologies while gradually building complexity.I've created a comprehensive 5-week lesson plan for your parallel computing course covering both CUDA and OpenMP. The course is structured to gradually build complexity while providing practical, hands-on experience.

**Key features of this lesson plan:**

1. **Progressive Learning**: Starts with environment setup and basic concepts, then advances to optimization techniques and real-world applications

2. **Dual Platform Support**: Includes detailed setup instructions for both Linux and Windows environments

3. **Demonstrative Examples**: Week 1 includes compelling demonstrations (matrix multiplication, image processing) to show the course scope and potential

4. **Practical Focus**: Each week balances theory (30 minutes) with hands-on implementation (60+ minutes)

5. **Comprehensive Exercises**: Every week includes progressively challenging exercises that reinforce the concepts

6. **Real-World Applications**: Final week focuses on hybrid programming and complete applications

The course covers essential topics including:
- Environment setup and verification
- OpenMP fundamentals and advanced features
- CUDA basics and memory management
- Performance optimization techniques
- Hybrid CPU-GPU programming
- Complete application development

Each week builds upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts, ensuring students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills in parallel computing.
